# Reflective Journal

## Week 1: 
the first week we learn about sractch programming language 

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a visual programming language that allows students to create their own interactive stories,
games and animations. As students design Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason
systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch was created by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at MIT
Media lab and its a non profitable organization.

### What is visual programming?
visual programming is an ideal programming launguage for devoloping sophisticated professional application for microsoft. it makes use of graphical user interface for creating robust and powerfull applications. this feature it eaiser to comprehendthings in quicker and easier way.Visual programming is a programming language that lets humans describe processes using illustration. Whereas a typical text-based programming language makes the programmer think like a computer, a visual programming language enables the programmer to describe the process in terms that make sense to humans.

### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
in the week 2 lab I made small project by using scratch, it was very easy using srcatch and lots of fun. here is i am attaching my project link https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/717602885

## Week 2:
Week 2 we learn about Way to use the git and git hub  

### What is git?
Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a Git repository hosting service that provides a web-based graphical interface. It is the world’s largest coding community. Putting a code or a project into GitHub brings it increased, widespread exposure. Programmers can find source codes in many different languages and use the command-line interface, Git, to make and keep track of any changes.

GitHub helps every team member work together on a project from any location while facilitating collaboration. You can also review previous versions created at an earlier point in time.

So now we know what Git and GitHub are. Time to gain a better understanding of the importance and relevance of what is GitHub by exploring its features.
here is some links i am attaching where i learnt more about github.

## Week 3:

### What is visual code?
Visual Studio Code is a free, lightweight but powerful source code editor that runs on your desktop and on the web and is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi OS. It comes with built-in support for python JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other programming languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, and Go), runtimes (such as .NET and Unity), environments (such as Docker and Kubernetes), and clouds (such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform

## Week 4:
What is Videograph?
this week was we all making some videos in mobile phones and submitted to romoan , it was fun and learn easy way 

## Week 5:
Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

Blockchain
Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.

A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant’s ledger. The decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).

## Week 6:
i am spending some tome on python and software project
