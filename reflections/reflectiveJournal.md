# Reflective Journal

## Week 1: 
the first week we learn about sractch programming language 

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a visual programming language that allows students to create their own interactive stories,
games and animations. As students design Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason
systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch was created by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at MIT
Media lab and its a non profitable organization.

### What is visual programming?
visual programming is an ideal programming launguage for devoloping sophisticated professional application for microsoft. it makes use of graphical user interface for creating robust and powerfull applications. this feature it eaiser to comprehendthings in quicker and easier way.Visual programming is a programming language that lets humans describe processes using illustration. Whereas a typical text-based programming language makes the programmer think like a computer, a visual programming language enables the programmer to describe the process in terms that make sense to humans.

### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
in the week 2 lab I made small project by using scratch, it was very easy using srcatch and lots of fun. here is i am attaching my project link https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/717602885

## Week 2:
Week 2 we learn about Way to use the git and git hub  

### What is git?
Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a Git repository hosting service that provides a web-based graphical interface. It is the worldâ€™s largest coding community. Putting a code or a project into GitHub brings it increased, widespread exposure. Programmers can find source codes in many different languages and use the command-line interface, Git, to make and keep track of any changes.

GitHub helps every team member work together on a project from any location while facilitating collaboration. You can also review previous versions created at an earlier point in time.

So now we know what Git and GitHub are. Time to gain a better understanding of the importance and relevance of what is GitHub by exploring its features.
here is some links i am attaching where i learnt more about github.
